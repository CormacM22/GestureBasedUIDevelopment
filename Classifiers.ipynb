    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "1. **SVM** performs the best across all metrics, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression** follows closely, with slightly lower scores compared to SVM.\n",
    "3. **Random Forest** has the lowest scores among the three models but still performs very well, with all metrics above 0.98.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that SVM is the most effective model for this dataset, but all three models demonstrate strong performance."
